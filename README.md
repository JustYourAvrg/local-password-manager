# local-password-manager
A Simple local password manager


# Description
This is a simple password manager that doesn't require any internet connection. It stores the passwords in a database file and encrypts the passwords.
It also uses a PIN lock to secure the application in case someone else uses your computer. (The pin is also encrypted while storing it in the database file.)
# IMPORTANT NOTE
Nothing is 100% secure, even the biggest companies get hacked. So, make sure to use 2FA/MFA (Two Factor Authentication / Multi Factor Authentication) for your important accounts. And also, make sure to use a strong PIN for the application.


# Installing the required libraries
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


# Running the application
open the terminal and change the directory to the project directory and run the following command
```bash
python main.py
```
